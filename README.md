## Targets

The front end are related with three different sections: **User site**, **Help Desk Work site**, and **Admin site**. Correspondly, the back end is many constituted of two tables: **User table** and **Message table**.

The tools for developing the web application, are **Visual Studio 2012** and **SQL Server 2014**, and the frame of the project is ASP MVC 4. I also use **jquery** to develop the front end, and adopt some tools to make life easier: **dataTables**, **jquery.ui.dialog**, and **ajax**. And These jquery tools can be obtained by seaching **NuGet Centre**.
